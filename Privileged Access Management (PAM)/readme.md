<b>Privileged Access Management (PAM) </b>is a security practice that controls and monitors access to privileged accounts and resources, addressing the need for preventing unauthorized access, reducing insider threats, and ensuring accountability.

<h3>Over the past decade, the key drivers that have contributed towards the evolution of PAM are:</h3>

- strong need to protect against insider threats, external attacks and data breaches.  
- Adoption of <b>Cloud and DevOps</b> 
- Focus on user experience and usability
- Emphasis on regulatory compliance requirements.
- Exponential increase in machine to machine interactions (<b>RPA, IOT, OT, DevOps, Application to Application,</b> so on and so forth)
