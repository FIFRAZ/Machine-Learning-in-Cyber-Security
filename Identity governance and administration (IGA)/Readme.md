<h3>My whiteboard notes cover:</h3>

- the key features a modern day <b>IGA(Identity Administration and Governance)</b> must include, and 
- the use cases where intelligence and automation can be incorporated using <b>Machine Learning</b>. 

Before you look at the notes, here is a brief overview of what an IGA solution is.

<h3>The primary goals of Identity administration and Governance are:</h3>

- <b>Identity Lifecycle Management:</b> This involves managing the entire lifecycle of digital identities, including creating, provisioning, modifying, and deactivating user accounts. It ensures that identities are created and managed in a consistent and secure manner. Includes appropriate workflows for Joiner, mover, leaver stages of identity lifecycle.

- <b>Authentication and Authorization: </b> Ensures that the right identity gets the right access, with just enough privileges, for the right duration, and with right justification for the access. This involves verifying the identity of users through methods like passwords, multi-factor authentication, biometrics, or smart cards. Implements RBAC, and in case of cloud data security, ABAC too, Just in time access, session management, logging and auditing. 

- <b>Compliance and Security: </b>IAG helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies related to identity management and data security. It provides mechanisms to enforce access controls, monitor user activities, detect and respond to security incidents, and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

- <b>Self-Service and User Provisioning:</b> IAG often includes self-service capabilities, allowing users to manage certain aspects of their identities, such as password resets or requesting access to specific resources. User provisioning automates the process of creating and managing user accounts, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistency.

Implementing an effective identity administration and governance program helps organizations improve security, streamline user access management processes, reduce administrative costs, and enhance regulatory compliance. It ensures that identities are properly managed throughout their lifecycle and that access controls align with business requirements and security best practices.

<h3>Key drivers for the evolution of IGA solutions in the recent years:</h3>

- With the increasing <b> adoption of cloud services </b> and the implementation of <b>DevOps practices</b>, identity governance and administration (IGA) products have adapted to meet the evolving needs of organizations. Today, IGA solutions offer additional features and capabilities to address the complexities of managing identities in modern IT landscapes, that covers providing centralized identity administration across both on-premises and <b>multi cloud environments</b>, ensuring consistent access controls and policy enforcement.

- IGA has expanded its capabilities to support <b>privileged access management (PAM)</b>. Privileged accounts, such as administrative and system accounts, pose significant security risks if not properly managed. IGA products now provide features to manage and monitor privileged access, including just-in-time access, session recording, and privileged user analytics. These enhancements strengthen security controls and help organizations prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. 

- Additionally, IGA solutions now incorporate <b>advanced analytics</b> and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. By analyzing <b>user behavior, access patterns, and risk indicators</b>, these tools can identify <b>anomalies and potential security threats</b> in real-time. They enable proactive risk mitigation, such as detecting and alerting on suspicious access attempts or unauthorized access requests.
