<B>Aim:</B>  To discover Roles by analyzing the similarity between users and their entitlements assignments, and hence create a Role structure that comprises minimum number of Roles providing maximum convergence for all entitlements.

In the process, also discover users who are <B>over-entitled</B>, take appropriate action via <B>UAR(User Access Review) Campaign</B>. 
An iterative process of running an unsupervised learning ML model(Graph plus clustering) and User Access Review campaign can be done periodically in an organization, can be utilized to identify over-entitled users and at the end of the process, a set of Roles that logically group the entitlements. 


The code showcases the prototype of how <B>graphs and clustering over graphs</B> can be utilized to achieve the same.
